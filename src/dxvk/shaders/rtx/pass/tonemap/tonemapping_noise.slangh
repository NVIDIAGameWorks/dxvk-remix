// Applies dithering to a color, ideally one in gamma space (for proper perceptual dithering).
// This does monochromatic dithering instead of using a different dithering pattern per
// channel - this correlates errors, but the monochromatic noise might be preferable from
// a visual, filmic standpoint as chromatic noise is more visually distracting typically and undesirable.
// The dithering pattern may also be optionally shifted over time, this may make the result
// visually smoother (due to persistence of vision averaging temporal noise samples together),
// but also may be more visually distracting in some cases versus a static pattern.
// Finally, this dithering only should be used on 8 bit unorm output targets (assuming quantization
// is done on write to a texture).
