NVIDIA RTX SDKs LICENSE

This license is a legal agreement between you and NVIDIA Corporation ("NVIDIA")
and governs the use of the NVIDIA RTX software development kits, including the
DLSS SDK, NGX SDK, RTXGI SDK, RTXDI SDK and/or NRD SDK, if and when made
available to you under this license (in each case, the "SDK"). This license can
be accepted only by an adult of legal age of majority in the country in which
the SDK is used. If you are under the legal age of majority, you must ask your
parent or legal guardian to consent to this license. If you are entering this
license on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you represent that you
have legal authority and "you" will mean the entity you represent. By using the
SDK, you affirm that you have reached the legal age of majority, you accept the
terms of this license, and you take legal and financial responsibility for the
actions of your permitted users. 

You agree to use the SDK only for purposes that are permitted by (a) this
license, and (b) any applicable law, regulation or generally accepted practices
or guidelines in the relevant jurisdictions.

1. LICENSE. Subject to the terms of this license and the terms in the supplement
attached, NVIDIA hereby grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable license,
without the right to sublicense (except as expressly provided in this license)
to: 

(a) Install and use the SDK,

(b) Modify and create derivative works of sample source code delivered in the
SDK, and

(c) Distribute any software and materials within the SDK, other than developer
tools provided for your internal use, as incorporated in object code format into
a software application subject to the distribution requirements indicated in
this license.

2. DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS. These are the distribution requirements for you to
exercise the grants above:

(a) An application must have material additional functionality, beyond the
included portions of the SDK. 

(b) The following notice shall be included in modifications and derivative works
of source code distributed: "This software contains source code provided by
NVIDIA Corporation." 

(c) You agree to distribute the SDK subject to the terms at least as protective
as the terms of this license, including (without limitation) terms relating to
the license grant, license restrictions and protection of NVIDIA's intellectual
property rights. Additionally, you agree that you will protect the privacy,
security and legal rights of your application users. 

(d) You agree to notify NVIDIA in writing of any known or suspected distribution
or use of the SDK not in compliance with the requirements of this license, and
to enforce the terms of your agreements with respect to the distributed portions
of the SDK. 

3. AUTHORIZED USERS. You may allow employees and contractors of your entity or
of your subsidiary(ies) to access and use the SDK from your secure network to
perform work on your behalf. If you are an academic institution you may allow
users enrolled or employed by the academic institution to access and use the SDK
from your secure network. You are responsible for the compliance with the terms
of this license by your authorized users. 

4. LIMITATIONS. Your license to use the SDK is restricted as follows:

(a) You may not reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble, or remove copyright
or other proprietary notices from any portion of the SDK or copies of the SDK. 

(b) Except as expressly provided in this license, you may not copy, sell, rent,
sublicense, transfer, distribute, modify, or create derivative works of any
portion of the SDK. For clarity, you may not distribute or sublicense the SDK as
a stand-alone product.

(c) Unless you have an agreement with NVIDIA for this purpose, you may not
indicate that an application created with the SDK is sponsored or endorsed by
NVIDIA.

(d) You may not bypass, disable, or circumvent any technical limitation,
encryption, security, digital rights management or authentication mechanism in
the SDK. 

(e) You may not use the SDK in any manner that would cause it to become subject
to an open source software license. As examples, licenses that require as a
condition of use, modification, and/or distribution that the SDK be: (i)
disclosed or distributed in source code form; (ii) licensed for the purpose of
making derivative works; or (iii) redistributable at no charge.

(f) Unless you have an agreement with NVIDIA for this purpose, you may not use
the SDK with any system or application where the use or failure of the system or
application can reasonably be expected to threaten or result in personal injury,
death, or catastrophic loss. Examples include use in avionics, navigation,
military, medical, life support or other life critical applications. NVIDIA does
not design, test or manufacture the SDK for these critical uses and NVIDIA shall
not be liable to you or any third party, in whole or in part, for any claims or
damages arising from such uses. 

(g) You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless NVIDIA and its affiliates,
and their respective employees, contractors, agents, officers and directors,
from and against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities,
costs or debt, fines, restitutions and expenses (including but not limited to
attorney's fees and costs incident to establishing the right of indemnification)
arising out of or related to your use of the SDK outside of the scope of this
license, or not in compliance with its terms. 

5. UPDATES. NVIDIA may, at its option, make available patches, workarounds or
other updates to this SDK. Unless the updates are provided with their separate
governing terms, they are deemed part of the SDK licensed to you as provided in
this license. You agree that the form and content of the SDK that NVIDIA
provides may change without prior notice to you. While NVIDIA generally
maintains compatibility between versions, NVIDIA may in some cases make changes
that introduce incompatibilities in future versions of the SDK.

6. PRE-RELEASE VERSIONS. SDK versions identified as alpha, beta, preview, early
access or otherwise as pre-release may not be fully functional, may contain
errors or design flaws, and may have reduced or different security, privacy,
availability, and reliability standards relative to commercial versions of
NVIDIA software and materials. You may use a pre-release SDK version at your own
risk, understanding that these versions are not intended for use in production
or business-critical systems. NVIDIA may choose not to make available a
commercial version of any pre-release SDK. NVIDIA may also choose to abandon
development and terminate the availability of a pre-release SDK at any time
without liability.

7. THIRD-PARTY COMPONENTS. The SDK may include third-party components with
separate legal notices or terms as may be described in proprietary notices
accompanying the SDK. If and to the extent there is a conflict between the terms
in this license and the third-party license terms, the third-party terms control
only to the extent necessary to resolve the conflict. 

8. OWNERSHIP. 

8.1 NVIDIA reserves all rights, title and interest in and to the SDK not
expressly granted to you under this license. NVIDIA and its suppliers hold all
rights, title and interest in and to the SDK, including their respective
intellectual property rights. The SDK is copyrighted and protected by the laws
of the United States and other countries, and international treaty provisions.

8.2 Subject to the rights of NVIDIA and its suppliers in the SDK, you hold all
rights, title and interest in and to your applications and your derivative works
of the sample source code delivered in the SDK including their respective
intellectual property rights. 
 
9. FEEDBACK. You may, but are not obligated to, provide Feedback to NVIDIA.
"Feedback" means all suggestions, fixes, modifications, feature requests or
other feedback regarding the SDK. Feedback, even if designated as confidential
by you, shall not create any confidentiality obligation for NVIDIA. NVIDIA and
its designees have a perpetual, non-exclusive, worldwide, irrevocable license to
use, reproduce, publicly display, modify, create derivative works of, license,
sublicense, and otherwise distribute and exploit Feedback as NVIDIA sees fit
without payment and without obligation or restriction of any kind on account of
intellectual property rights or otherwise.

10. NO WARRANTIES. THE SDK IS PROVIDED AS-IS. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW NVIDIA AND ITS AFFILIATES EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES OF
ANY KIND OR NATURE, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING, BUT NOT
LIMITED TO, WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. NVIDIA DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SDK WILL MEET YOUR
REQUIREMENTS OR THAT THE OPERATION THEREOF WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE,
OR THAT ALL ERRORS WILL BE CORRECTED. 

11. LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW
NVIDIA AND ITS AFFILIATES SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL,
PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY LOST PROFITS, PROJECT DELAYS, LOSS
OF USE, LOSS OF DATA OR LOSS OF GOODWILL, OR THE COSTS OF PROCURING SUBSTITUTE

PERFORMANCE OF THE SDK, WHETHER SUCH LIABILITY ARISES FROM ANY CLAIM BASED UPON
BREACH OF CONTRACT, BREACH OF WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCT
LIABILITY OR ANY OTHER CAUSE OF ACTION OR THEORY OF LIABILITY, EVEN IF NVIDIA
HAS PREVIOUSLY BEEN ADVISED OF, OR COULD REASONABLY HAVE FORESEEN, THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT WILL NVIDIA'S AND ITS AFFILIATES TOTAL
CUMULATIVE LIABILITY UNDER OR ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE EXCEED US$10.00. THE
NATURE OF THE LIABILITY OR THE NUMBER OF CLAIMS OR SUITS SHALL NOT ENLARGE OR
EXTEND THIS LIMIT. 

12. TERMINATION. Your rights under this license will terminate automatically
without notice from NVIDIA if you fail to comply with any term and condition of
this license or if you commence or participate in any legal proceeding against
NVIDIA with respect to the SDK. NVIDIA may terminate this license with advance
written notice to you, if NVIDIA decides to no longer provide the SDK in a
country or, in NVIDIA's sole discretion, the continued use of it is no longer
commercially viable. Upon any termination of this license, you agree to promptly
discontinue use of the SDK and destroy all copies in your possession or control.

not be assigned by you by any means or operation of law without NVIDIA's
permission. Any attempted assignment not approved by NVIDIA in writing shall be
void and of no effect. NVIDIA may assign, delegate or transfer this license and
its rights and obligations, and if to a non-affiliate you will be notified.

NVIDIA RTX SUPPLEMENT TO SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT FOR NVIDIA SOFTWARE
DEVELOPMENT KITS

The terms in this supplement govern your use of the NVIDIA RTX SDKs, including
the DLSS SDK, NGX SDK, RTXGI SDK, RTXDI SDK and/or NRD SDK, if and when made
available to you (in each case, the "SDK") under the terms of your license
agreement ("Agreement") as modified by this supplement. Capitalized terms used
but not defined below have the meaning assigned to them in the Agreement.

This supplement is an exhibit to the Agreement and is incorporated as an
integral part of the Agreement. In the event of conflict between the terms in
this supplement and the terms in the Agreement, the terms in this supplement
govern. 

1. Interoperability. Your applications that incorporate, or are based on, the
SDK must be fully interoperable with compatible GPU hardware products designed
by NVIDIA or its affiliates. Further, the DLSS SDK and NGX SDK are licensed for
you to develop applications only for their use in systems with NVIDIA GPUs.

2. Limitations for the DLSS SDK and NGX SDK. Your applications that incorporate,
or are based on, the DLSS SDK or NGX SDK may be deployed in a cloud service that
runs on systems that consume NVIDIA vGPU software, and any other cloud service
use of such SDKs or their functionality is outside of the scope of the
Agreement. For the purpose of this section, cloud services include application
service providers or service bureaus, operators of hosted/virtual system
environments, or hosting, time sharing or providing any other type of service to
others. 

3. Notification for the DLSS SDK and NGX SDK. You are required to notify NVIDIA
prior to commercial release of an application (including a plug-in to a
commercial application) that incorporates, or is based on, the DLSS SDK or NGX
SDK. Please send notifications to: https://developer.nvidia.com/sw-notification
and provide the following information in the email: company name, publisher and
developer name, NVIDIA SDK used, application name, platform (i.e. PC, Linux),
scheduled ship date, and weblink to product/video. 

4. Audio and Video Encoders and Decoders. You acknowledge and agree that it is
your sole responsibility to obtain any additional third-party licenses required
to make, have made, use, have used, sell, import, and offer for sale your
products or services that include or incorporate any third-party software and
content relating to audio and/or video encoders and decoders from, including but
not limited to, Microsoft, Thomson, Fraunhofer IIS, Sisvel S.p.A., MPEG-LA, and
Coding Technologies. NVIDIA does not grant to you under this Agreement any
necessary patent or other rights with respect to any audio and/or video encoders
and decoders. 

5. DLSS SDK Terms. By installing or using the DLSS SDK you agree that NVIDIA can
make over-the-air updates of DLSS in systems that have DLSS installed, including
(without limitation) for quality, stability or performance improvements or to
support new hardware. If you publicly release a DLSS integration in an end user
game or application that presents material stability, performance, image
quality, or other technical issues impacting the user experience, you will work
to quickly address the integration issues. In the case issues are not addressed,
NVIDIA reserves the right, as a last resort, to temporarily disable the DLSS
integration until the issues can be fixed.

6. Marketing.

6.1 Marketing Activities. Your license to the SDK(s) under the Agreement is
subject to your compliance with the following marketing terms:

(a) Identification by You in the DLSS SDK or NGX SDK. During the term of the
Agreement, NVIDIA agrees that you may identify NVIDIA on your websites, printed
collateral, trade-show displays and other retail packaging materials, as the
supplier of the DLSS SDK or NGX SDK for the applications that were developed
with use of such SDKs, provided that all such references to NVIDIA will be
subject to NVIDIA's prior review and written approval, which will not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed. 

(b) NVIDIA Trademark Placement in Applications with the DLSS SDK or NGX SDK. 
For applications that incorporate the DLSS SDK or NGX SDK or portions thereof,
you must attribute the use of the applicable SDK and include the NVIDIA Marks
on splash screens, in the about box of the application (if present), and in
credits for game applications.

(c) NVIDIA Trademark Placement in Applications with a licensed SDK, other than
the DLSS SDK or NGX SDK. For applications that incorporates and/or makes use of
a licensed SDK, other than the DLSS SDK or NGX SDK, you must attribute the use
of the applicable SDK and include the NVIDIA Marks on the credit screen for
applications that have such credit screen, or where a credit screen is not
present prominently in end user documentation for the application. d)
Identification by NVIDIA in the DLSS SDK or NGX SDK. You agree that NVIDIA may
identify you on NVIDIA's websites, printed collateral, trade-show displays, and
other retail packaging materials as an individual or entity that produces
products and services which incorporate the DLSS SDK or NGX SDK as applicable.
To the extent that you provide NVIDIA with input or usage requests with regard
to the use of your logo or materials, NVIDIA will use commercially reasonable
efforts to comply with such requests. For the avoidance of doubt, NVIDIA's
rights pursuant to this section shall survive any expiration or termination of
the Agreement with respect to existing applications which incorporate the DLSS
SDK or NGX SDK.

(e) Applications Marketing Material in the DLSS SDK or NGX SDK. You may provide
NVIDIA with screenshots, imagery, and video footage of applications
representative of your use of the NVIDIA DLSS SDK or NGX SDKs in your

the Assets to promote and market the NVIDIA RTX SDKs. To the extent you
provide NVIDIA with input or usage requests with regard to the use of your logo
or materials, NVIDIA will use commercially reasonable efforts to comply with
such requests. For the avoidance of doubt, NVIDIA's rights pursuant to this
section shall survive any termination of the Agreement with respect to
applications which incorporate the NVIDIA RTX SDK.

6.2 Trademark Ownership and Licenses. Trademarks are owned and licenses as
follows:

(a) Ownership of Trademarks. Each party owns the trademarks, logos, and trade
names (collectively "Marks") for their respective products or services,
including without limitation in applications, and the NVIDIA RTX SDKs. Each
party agrees to use the Marks of the other only as permitted in this exhibit.

(b) Trademark License to NVIDIA. You grant to NVIDIA a non-exclusive, non-sub
licensable, non-transferable (except as set forth in the assignment provision
of the Agreement), worldwide license to refer to you and your applications, and
to use your Marks on NVIDIA's marketing materials and on NVIDIA's website
(subject to any reasonable conditions of you) solely for NVIDIA's marketing
activities set forth in this exhibit Sections (d)-(e) above. NVIDIA will
follow your specifications for your Marks as to style, color, and typeface as
reasonably provided to NVIDIA.

(c) Trademark License to You. NVIDIA grants to you a non-exclusive, non-sub
licensable, non-transferable (except as set forth in the assignment provision
of the Agreement), worldwide license, subject to the terms of this exhibit and
the Agreement, to use NVIDIA RTX™, NVIDIA GeForce RTX™ in combination with
GeForce products, and/or NVIDIA Quadro RTX™ in combination with Quadro
products (collectively, the "NVIDIA Marks") on your marketing materials and on
your website (subject to any reasonable conditions of NVIDIA) solely for your
marketing activities set forth in this exhibit Sections 6.1 (a)-(c) above. For
the avoidance of doubt, you will not and will not permit others to use any
NVIDIA Mark for any other goods or services, or in a way that tarnishes,
degrades, disparages or reflects adversely any of the NVIDIA Marks or NVIDIA's
business or reputation, or that dilutes or otherwise harms the value,
reputation or distinctiveness of or NVIDIA's goodwill in any NVIDIA Mark. In
addition to the termination rights set forth in the Agreement, NVIDIA may
terminate this trademark license at any time upon written notice to you. You
will follow NVIDIA's use guidelines and specifications for NVIDIA's Marks as to
style, color and typeface as provided in NVIDIA Marks and submit a sample of
each proposed use of NVIDIA's Marks at least ten (10) business days prior to
the desired implementation of such use to obtain NVIDIA's prior written
approval (which approval will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Use of
NVIDIA marks is not authorized until NVIDIA provides written approval. All
goodwill associated with use of NVIDIA Marks will inure to the sole benefit of
NVIDIA.

6.3 Use Guidelines. Use of the NVIDIA Marks is subject to the following
guidelines:

(a) Business Practices. You covenant that you will: (a) conduct business with
respect to NVIDIA's products in a manner that reflects favorably at all times
on the good name, goodwill and reputation of such products; (b) avoid
deceptive, misleading or unethical practices that are detrimental to NVIDIA,
its customers, or end users; (c) make no false or misleading representations
with regard to NVIDIA or its products; and (d) not publish or employ or
cooperate in the publication or employment of any misleading or deceptive
advertising or promotional materials.

(b) No Combination Marks or Similar Marks. You agree not to (a) combine NVIDIA
Marks with any other content without NVIDIA's prior written approval, or (b)
use any other trademark, trade name, or other designation of source which
creates a likelihood of confusion with NVIDIA Marks.

Here, glslang proper means core GLSL parsing, HLSL parsing, and SPIR-V code
generation. Glslang proper requires use of a number of licenses, one that covers
preprocessing and others that covers non-preprocessing.

Bison was removed long ago. You can build glslang from the source grammar,
using tools of your choice, without using bison or any bison files.

Other parts, outside of glslang proper, include:

- gl_types.h, only needed for OpenGL-like reflection, and can be left out of
  a parse and codegen project.  See it for its license.

- update_glslang_sources.py, which is not part of the project proper and does
  not need to be used.

- the SPIR-V "remapper", which is optional, but has the same license as
  glslang proper

- Google tests and SPIR-V tools, and anything in the external subdirectory
  are external and optional; see them for their respective licenses.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The core of glslang-proper, minus the preprocessor is licenced as follows:

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.

  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.

  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.

  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.

  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.

  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.

  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

  1. Source Code.

  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
form of a work.

  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
is widely used among developers working in that language.

  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
includes interface definition files associated with source files for
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
subprograms and other parts of the work.

  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
Source.

  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
same work.

  2. Basic Permissions.

  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
makes it unnecessary.

  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
measures.

  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
technological measures.

  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
    it, and giving a relevant date.

    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
    released under this License and any conditions added under section
    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
    "keep intact all notices".

    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
    work need not make them do so.

  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
parts of the aggregate.

  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
in one of these ways:

    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
    customarily used for software interchange.

    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
    with subsection 6b.

    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.

    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
    charge under subsection 6d.

  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
included in conveying the object code work.

  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
the only significant mode of use of the product.

  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
modification has been made.

  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
been installed in ROM).

  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
protocols for communication across the network.

  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
source code form), and must require no special password or key for
unpacking, reading or copying.

  7. Additional Terms.

  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
this License without regard to the additional permissions.

  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or

    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
    authors of the material; or

    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
    those licensors and authors.

  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
governed by this License along with a term that is a further
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
not survive such relicensing or conveying.

  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
where to find the applicable terms.

  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
the above requirements apply either way.

  8. Termination.

  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).

  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
prior to 60 days after the cessation.

  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
material under section 10.

  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

  11. Patents.

  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".

  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
this License.

  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
propagate the contents of its contributor version.

  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
patent against the party.

  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
country that you have reason to believe are valid.

  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
work and works based on it.

  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
combination as such.

  14. Revised Versions of this License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
version or of any later version published by the Free Software
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
to choose that version for the Program.

  Later license versions may give you additional or different
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
later version.

  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. Limitation of Liability.

  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.

  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
copy of the Program in return for a fee.

Bison Exception

As a special exception, you may create a larger work that contains part or all
of the Bison parser skeleton and distribute that work under terms of your
choice, so long as that work isn't itself a parser generator using the skeleton
or a modified version thereof as a parser skeleton.  Alternatively, if you
modify or redistribute the parser skeleton itself, you may (at your option)
remove this special exception, which will cause the skeleton and the resulting
Bison output files to be licensed under the GNU General Public License without
this special exception.

This special exception was added by the Free Software Foundation in version
2.2 of Bison.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

LICENSE AGREEMENT FOR NVIDIA SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT KITS

This license agreement, including exhibits attached ("Agreement") is a legal agreement
between you and NVIDIA Corporation ("NVIDIA") and governs your use of a NVIDIA software
development kit ("SDK"). 

Each SDK has its own set of software and materials, but here is a description of the types
of items that may be included in a SDK: source code, header files, APIs, data sets and
assets (examples include images, textures, models, scenes, videos, native API input/output
files), binary software, sample code, libraries, utility programs, programming code and
documentation. 

This Agreement can be accepted only by an adult of legal age of majority in the country in
which the SDK is used. 

If you are entering into this Agreement on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you
represent that you have the legal authority to bind the entity to this Agreement, in which
case "you" will mean the entity you represent. 

If you don’t have the required age or authority to accept this Agreement, or if you don’t
accept all the terms and conditions of this Agreement, do not download, install or use the
SDK.  

You agree to use the SDK only for purposes that are permitted by (a) this Agreement, and
(b) any applicable law, regulation or generally accepted practices or guidelines in the
relevant jurisdictions.

1.  License. 

1.1 Grant

Subject to the terms of this Agreement, NVIDIA hereby grants you a non-exclusive,
non-transferable license, without the right to sublicense (except as expressly provided in
this Agreement) to: 

(i) Install and use the SDK, and

(ii) Distribute those portions of the SDK that are identified in this Agreement as
distributable, as incorporated in object code format into a software application that
meets the distribution requirements indicated in this Agreement.

1.2 Distribution Requirements

These are the distribution requirements for you to exercise the distribution grant:

(i) Your application must have material additional functionality, beyond the included
portions of the SDK.

(ii) The distributable portions of the SDK shall only be accessed by your application.  

(iii) The following notice shall be included in modifications and derivative works of
sample source code distributed: "This software contains source code provided by NVIDIA
Corporation."

(iv) Unless a developer tool is identified in this Agreement as distributable, it is
delivered for your internal use only.

(v) The terms under which you distribute your application must be consistent with the
terms of this Agreement, including (without limitation) terms relating to the license
grant and license restrictions and protection of NVIDIA’s intellectual property rights.
Additionally, you agree that you will protect the privacy, security and legal rights of
your application users. 

(vi) You agree to notify NVIDIA in writing of any known or suspected distribution or use
of the SDK not in compliance with the requirements of this Agreement, and to enforce the
terms of your agreements with respect to distributed SDK.

1.3 Authorized Users

You may allow employees and contractors of your entity or of your subsidiary(ies) to
access and use the SDK from your secure network to perform work on your behalf. 

If you are an academic institution you may allow users enrolled or employed by the
academic institution to access and use the SDK from your secure network. 

You are responsible for the compliance with the terms of this Agreement by your authorized
users. If you become aware that your authorized users didn’t follow the terms of this
Agreement, you agree to take reasonable steps to resolve the non-compliance and prevent
new occurrences. 

1.4 Pre-Release SDK

The SDK versions identified as alpha, beta, preview or otherwise as pre-release, may not
be fully functional, may contain errors or design flaws, and may have reduced or different
security, privacy, accessibility, availability, and reliability standards relative to
commercial versions of NVIDIA software and materials. Use of a pre-release SDK may result
in unexpected results, loss of data, project delays or other unpredictable damage or loss.
You may use a pre-release SDK at your own risk, understanding that pre-release SDKs are
not intended for use in production or business-critical systems.  NVIDIA may choose not to
make available a commercial version of any pre-release SDK. NVIDIA may also choose to
abandon development and terminate the availability of a pre-release SDK at any time
without liability.

1.5 Updates

NVIDIA may, at its option, make available patches, workarounds or other updates to this
SDK. Unless the updates are provided with their separate governing terms, they are deemed
part of the SDK licensed to you as provided in this Agreement.

You agree that the form and content of the SDK that NVIDIA provides may change without
prior notice to you. While NVIDIA generally maintains compatibility between versions,
NVIDIA may in some cases make changes that introduce incompatibilities in future versions
of the SDK.

1.6 Third Party Licenses

The SDK may come bundled with, or otherwise include or be distributed with, third party
software licensed by a NVIDIA supplier and/or open source software provided under an open
source license. Use of third-party software is subject to the third-party license terms,
or in the absence of third party terms, the terms of this Agreement. Copyright to
third-party software is held by the copyright holders indicated in the third-party
software or license.

1.7 Reservation of Rights

NVIDIA reserves all rights, title and interest in and to the SDK not expressly granted to
you under this Agreement.

2.  Limitations. 

The following license limitations apply to your use of the SDK:

2.1 You may not reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble, or remove copyright or other
proprietary notices from any portion of the SDK or copies of the SDK. 

2.2 Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, you may not copy, sell, rent,
sublicense, transfer, distribute, modify, or create derivative works of any portion of the
SDK. 

2.3 Unless you have an agreement with NVIDIA for this purpose, you may not indicate that
an application created with the SDK is sponsored or endorsed by NVIDIA. 

2.4 You may not bypass, disable, or circumvent any encryption, security, digital rights
management or authentication mechanism in the SDK. 

2.5 You may not use the SDK in any manner that would cause it to become subject to an open
source software license. As examples, licenses that require as a condition of use,
modification, and/or distribution that the SDK be (i) disclosed or distributed in source
code form; (ii) licensed for the purpose of making derivative works; or (iii)
redistributable at no charge.

2.6 Unless you have an agreement with NVIDIA for this purpose, you may not use the SDK
with any system or application where the use or failure of the system or application can
reasonably be expected to threaten or result in personal injury, death, or catastrophic
loss. Examples include use in nuclear, avionics, navigation, military, medical, life
support or other life critical applications. NVIDIA does not design, test or manufacture
the SDK for these critical uses and NVIDIA shall not be liable to you or any third party,
in whole or in part, for any claims or damages arising from such uses. 

2.7 You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless NVIDIA and its affiliates, and their
respective employees, contractors, agents, officers and directors, from and against any
and all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs or debt, fines,
restitutions and expenses (including but not limited to attorney’s fees and costs incident
to establishing the right of indemnification) arising out of or related to your use of the
SDK outside of the scope of this Agreement, or not in compliance with its terms.

3.  Ownership. 

3.1 NVIDIA or its licensors hold all rights, title and interest in and to the SDK and its
modifications and derivative works, including their respective intellectual property
rights. This SDK may include software and materials from NVIDIA’s licensors, and these
licensors are intended third party beneficiaries that may enforce this Agreement with
respect to their intellectual property rights. 

3.2 You may, but don’t have to, provide to NVIDIA suggestions, feature requests or other
feedback regarding the SDK, including possible enhancements or modifications to the SDK.
For any feedback that you voluntarily provide, you hereby grant NVIDIA and its affiliates
a perpetual, non-exclusive, worldwide, irrevocable license to use, reproduce, modify,
license, sublicense (through multiple tiers of sublicensees), and distribute (through
multiple tiers of distributors) it without the payment of any royalties or fees to you.
NVIDIA will use feedback at its choice. NVIDIA is constantly looking for ways to improve
its products, so you may send feedback to NVIDIA through the developer portal at
https://developer.nvidia.com.

4.  No Warranties. 

THE SDK IS PROVIDED BY NVIDIA "AS IS" AND "WITH ALL FAULTS." TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT
PERMITTED BY LAW, NVIDIA AND ITS AFFILIATES EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND
OR NATURE, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,
OR THE ABSENCE OF ANY DEFECTS THEREIN, WHETHER LATENT OR PATENT. NO WARRANTY IS MADE ON
THE BASIS OF TRADE USAGE, COURSE OF DEALING OR COURSE OF TRADE. 

5.  Limitations of Liability. 

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NVIDIA AND ITS AFFILIATES SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR
ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR ANY LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF
USE, LOSS OF DATA OR LOSS OF GOODWILL, OR THE COSTS OF PROCURING SUBSTITUTE PRODUCTS,
ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE USE OR PERFORMANCE OF THE SDK,
WHETHER SUCH LIABILITY ARISES FROM ANY CLAIM BASED UPON BREACH OF CONTRACT, BREACH OF
WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCT LIABILITY OR ANY OTHER CAUSE OF ACTION OR
THEORY OF LIABILITY. IN NO EVENT WILL NVIDIA’S AND ITS AFFILIATES TOTAL CUMULATIVE
LIABILITY UNDER OR ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT EXCEED US$10.00. THE NATURE OF THE
LIABILITY OR THE NUMBER OF CLAIMS OR SUITS SHALL NOT ENLARGE OR EXTEND THIS LIMIT. 

These exclusions and limitations of liability shall apply regardless if NVIDIA or its
affiliates have been advised of the possibility of such damages, and regardless of whether
a remedy fails its essential purpose. These exclusions and limitations of liability form
an essential basis of the bargain between the parties, and, absent any of these exclusions
or limitations of liability, the provisions of this Agreement, including, without
limitation, the economic terms, would be substantially different. 

6.  Termination. 

6.1 This Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by either you or NVIDIA as
described below. 

6.2 If you want to terminate this Agreement, you may do so by stopping to use the SDK. 

6.3 NVIDIA may, at any time, terminate this Agreement if: (i) you fail to comply with any
term of this Agreement and the non-compliance is not fixed within thirty (30) days
following notice from NVIDIA (or immediately if you violate NVIDIA’s intellectual property
rights); (ii) you commence or participate in any legal proceeding against NVIDIA with
respect to the SDK; or (iii) NVIDIA decides to no longer provide the SDK in a country or,
in NVIDIA’s sole discretion, the continued use of it is no longer commercially viable. 

6.4 Upon any termination of this Agreement, you agree to promptly discontinue use of the
SDK and destroy all copies in your possession or control. Your prior distributions in
accordance with this Agreement are not affected by the termination of this Agreement. Upon
written request, you will certify in writing that you have complied with your commitments
under this section. Upon any termination of this Agreement all provisions survive except
for the licenses granted to you. 

7.  General.  
 
If you wish to assign this Agreement or your rights and obligations, including by merger,
consolidation, dissolution or operation of law, contact NVIDIA to ask for permission. Any
attempted assignment not approved by NVIDIA in writing shall be void and of no effect.
NVIDIA may assign, delegate or transfer this Agreement and its rights and obligations, and
if to a non-affiliate you will be notified. 

You agree to cooperate with NVIDIA and provide reasonably requested information to verify
your compliance with this Agreement.

This Agreement will be governed in all respects by the laws of the United States and of
the State of Delaware as those laws are applied to contracts entered into and performed
entirely within Delaware by Delaware residents, without regard to the conflicts of laws
principles. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods
is specifically disclaimed. You agree to all terms of this Agreement in the English
language.

The state or federal courts residing in Santa Clara County, California shall have
exclusive jurisdiction over any dispute or claim arising out of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding this, you agree that NVIDIA shall still be allowed to apply for injunctive
remedies or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief in any jurisdiction. 

If any court of competent jurisdiction determines that any provision of this Agreement is
illegal, invalid or unenforceable, such provision will be construed as limited to the
extent necessary to be consistent with and fully enforceable under the law and the
remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect. Unless otherwise specified,
remedies are cumulative.

Each party acknowledges and agrees that the other is an independent contractor in the
performance of this Agreement. 

The SDK has been developed entirely at private expense and is "commercial items"
consisting of "commercial computer software" and "commercial computer software
documentation" provided with RESTRICTED RIGHTS. Use, duplication or disclosure by the U.S.

    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide
    additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or
    distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole,
    provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with

    NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely
    responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work
    and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

    (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law
    (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any
    Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
    incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this
    License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to
    damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any
    and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised
    of the possibility of such damages.

    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or
    Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of
    support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent
    with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your
    own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor,
    and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any
    liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your
    accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
