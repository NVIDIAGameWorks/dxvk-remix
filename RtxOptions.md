# RTX Options
RTX Options are configurable parameters for RTX pipeline components. They can be set via rtx.conf in a following format:

```
<RTX Option int scalar> = <Integer value>
<RTX Option float scalar> = <Floating point value>
<RTX Option int vector> = <Integer value>, <Integer value>, ...
<RTX Option float vector> = <Floating point value>, <Floating point value>, ...
<RTX Option boolean> = True/False
<RTX Option string> = <String value, no quotes>
<RTX Option hash set/vector> = <Hex string>, <Hex string>, ...
```

Practical examples of syntax:

```
rtx.someIntScalar = 38
rtx.someFloatScalar = 29.39
rtx.someIntVector = 1, -2, 3
rtx.someFloatVector = 1.0, -2.0, 3.0
rtx.someBoolean = True
# Note: Leading whitespace in a string is removed, allowing for nicer option formatting like this without messing up the string.
# Additionally, strings should not be surrounded with quotes as these will be treated as part of the string.
rtx.someString = This is a string
# Note: 0x prefix on hash hex values here is optional, similarly these values are case-insensitive. 16 hex characters = 64 bit hash.
rtx.someHashSet = 8DD6F568BD126398, EEF8EFD4B8A1B2A5, ...
```

RTX Options may be set in multiple places, specifically a hardcoded set in `src/util/config/config.cpp` which is assigned per-application based on process name, and the two user-configurable files `dxvk.conf` and `rtx.conf`. If not set the options will inherit their default values.
The full order of precedence for how each set of options overrides the previous is as follows:

1. Default option value (Implicit)
2. `dxvk.conf` ("User Config")
3. Per-application `config.cpp` configuration ("Built-in Config")
4. `rtx.conf` ("RTX User Config")
  1. `baseGameModPath/rtx.conf` (Mod-specific extension of "RTX User Config")

Additionally, upon saving options from the Remix UI options are written only to rtx.conf.

Tables below enumerate all the options and their defaults set by RTX Remix. Note that this information is auto-generated by the RTX Remix application. To re-generate this file, run Remix with `DXVK_DOCUMENTATION_WRITE_RTX_OPTIONS_MD=1` defined in the environment variables.

|rtx.enableFirstBounceLobeProbabilityDithering|bool|True|A flag to enable or disable screen\-space probability dithering on the first indirect lobe sampled\.<br>Generally sampling a diffuse, specular or other lobe relies on a random number generated against the probability of sampling each lobe, effectively focusing more rays/paths on lobes which matter more\.<br>This can cause issues however with denoisers which do not handle sparse stochastic signals \(like those from path tracing\) well as they may be expecting a more "complete" signal like those used in simpler branching ray tracing setups\.<br>To help solve this issue this option uses a temporal screenspace dithering based on the probability rather than a purely random choice to determine which lobe to sample from on the first indirect bounce\.<br>This as a result helps ensure there will always be a diffuse or specular sample within the dithering pattern's area and should help the denoising resolve a more stable result\.|

Only takes effect when fog remapping in general is enabled\.<br>Enables or disables remapping functionality relating to the max distance parameter of fixed function fog\.<br>This allows dynamic changes to the game's fog max distance to be reflected somewhat in the volumetrics system\.

|rtx.enableFogRemap|bool|False|A flag to enable or disable fixed function fog remapping\. Only takes effect when volumetrics are enabled\.<br>Typically many old games used fixed function fog for various effects and while sometimes this fog can be replaced with proper volumetrics globally, other times require some amount of dynamic behavior controlled by the game\.<br>When enabled this option allows for remapping of fixed function fog parameters from the game to volumetric parameters to accomodate this dynamic need\.|
|rtx.enableIndirectTranslucentShadows|bool|False|Include OBJECT\_MASK\_TRANSLUCENT into secondary visibility rays\.|
|rtx.enableInstanceDebuggingTools|bool|False|NOTE: This will disable temporal correllation for instances, but allow the use of instance developer debug tools|
|rtx.enableMultiStageTextureFactorBlending|bool|True|Support texture factor blending in stage 1~7\. Currently only support 1 additional blending stage, more than 1 additional blending stages will be ignored\.|
|rtx.enableNearPlaneOverride|bool|False|A flag to enable or disable the Camera's near plane override feature\.<br>Since the camera is not used directly for ray tracing the near plane the application uses typically does not matter, but for certain matrix\-based operations \(such as temporal reprojection or voxel grid projection\) it is still relevant\.<br>The issue arises when geometry is ray traced that is behind where the chosen Camera's near plane is located, typically common on viewmodels especially with how they are ray traced, causing graphical artifacts and other issues\.<br>This option helps correct this issue by overriding the near plane value to else \(usually smaller\) to sit behind the objects in question \(such as the view model\)\. As such this option should usually be enabled on games with viewmodels\.<br>Do note that when adjusting the near plane the larger the relative magnitude gap between the near and far plane the worse the precision of matrix operations will be, so the near plane should be set as high as possible even when overriding\.|
|rtx.enablePSRR|bool|True|A flag to enable or disable reflection PSR \(Primary Surface Replacement\)\.<br>When enabled this feature allows higher quality mirror\-like reflections in special cases by replacing the G\-Buffer's surface with the reflected surface\.<br>Should usually be enabled for the sake of quality as almost all applications will utilize it in the form of glass or mirrors\.|
|rtx.enablePSTR|bool|True|A flag to enable or disable transmission PSR \(Primary Surface Replacement\)\.<br>When enabled this feature allows higher quality glass\-like refraction in special cases by replacing the G\-Buffer's surface with the refracted surface\.<br>Should usually be enabled for the sake of quality as almost all applications will utilize it in the form of glass\.|
|rtx.enablePSTROutgoingSplitApproximation|bool|True|Enable transmission PSR on outgoing transmission events such as leaving translucent materials \(rather than respecting no\-split path PSR rule\)\.<br>Typically this results in better looking glass when enabled \(at the cost of accuracy due to ignoring non\-TIR inter\-reflections within the glass itself\)\.|
|rtx.enablePSTRSecondaryIncidentSplitApproximation|bool|True|Enable transmission PSR on secondary incident transmission events such as entering a translucent material on an already\-transmitted path \(rather than respecting no\-split path PSR rule\)\.<br>Typically this results in better looking glass when enabled \(at the cost accuracy due to ignoring reflections off of glass seen through glass for example\)\.|

|rtx.enableRussianRoulette|bool|True|A flag to enable or disable Russian Roulette, a rendering technique to give paths a chance of terminating randomly with each bounce based on their importance\.<br>This is usually useful to have enabled as it will ensure useless paths are terminated earlier while more important paths are allowed to accumulate more bounces\.<br>Furthermore this allows for the renderer to remain unbiased whereas a hard clamp on the number of bounces will introduce bias \(though this is also done in Remix for the sake of performance\)\.<br>On the other hand, randomly terminating paths too aggressively may leave threads in GPU warps without work which may hurt thread occupancy when not used with a thread\-reordering technique like SER\.|

|rtx.forceCameraJitter|bool|False||
|rtx.forceCutoutAlpha|float|0.5|When an object is added to the cutout textures list it will have a cutout alpha mode forced on it, using this value for the alpha test\.<br>This is meant to improve the look of some legacy mode materials using low\-resolution textures and alpha blending instead of alpha cutout as this can cause blurry halos around edges due to the difficulty of handling this sort of blending in Remix\.<br>Such objects are generally better handled with actual replacement assets using fully opaque geometry replacements or alpha cutout with higher resolution textures, so this should only be relied on until proper replacements can be authored\.|
|rtx.forceHighResolutionReplacementTextures|bool|False|A flag to enable or disable forcing high resolution replacement textures\.<br>When enabled this mode overrides all other methods of mip calculation \(adaptive resolution and the minimum mipmap level\) and forces it to be 0 to always load in the highest quality of textures\.<br>This generally should not be used other than for various forms of debugging or visual comparisons as this mode will ignore any constraints on CPU or GPU memory which may starve the system or Remix of memory\.<br>Additionally, this setting must be set at startup and changing it will not take effect at runtime\.|

|rtx.indirectRaySpreadAngleFactor|float|0.05|A tuning factor applied to the spread angle calculated from the sampled lobe solid angle PDF\. Should be 0\-1\.<br>This scaled spread angle is used to widen a ray's cone angle after indirect lighting BRDF samples to essentially prefilter the effects of the BRDF lobe's spread which potentially may reduce noise from indirect rays \(e\.g\. reflections\)\.<br>Prefiltering will overblur detail however compared to the ground truth of casting multiple samples especially given this calculated spread angle is a basic approximation and ray cones to begin with are a simple approximation for ray pixel footprint\.<br>As such rather than using the spread angle fully this spread angle factor allows it to be scaled down to something more narrow so that overblurring can be minimized\.

The system requires "Terrain Textures" to contain hashes of the terrain textures to apply\.<br>Only use this system if the game renders terrain surfaces with multiple blended surfaces on top of each other \(i\.e\. sand mixed with dirt, grass, snow, etc\.\)\.<br>Requirement: the baked terrain surfaces must not be placed vertically in the game world\. Horizontal surfaces will have the best image quality\. Requires "rtx\.zUp" to be set properly\.|
|rtx.terrainBaker.material.bakeReplacementMaterials|bool|True|Enables baking of replacement materials when they are present\.|
|rtx.terrainBaker.material.bakeSecondaryPBRTextures|bool|True|Enables baking of secondary textures in replacement materials when they are present\.<br>Secondary textures are all PBR textures except for albedoOpacity\. So that includes normal, roughness, etc\.|
|rtx.terrainBaker.material.maxResolutionToUseForReplacementMaterials|int|8192|Max resolution to use for preprocessing and baking of input replacement material textures other than color opacity which is used as is\.<br>Applies only to a case when a preprocessing compute shader is used to support baking of secondary PBR materials\.<br>Replacement materials need to be preprocessed prior to baking them and limitting the max resolution allows to balance the quality vs performance cost\.|
|rtx.terrainBaker.material.properties.displaceInFactor|float|1|The max depth the baked terrain can support will be larger than the max depth <br>of any incoming draw call, which results in a loss of detail\.

The current support for this is limitted to draw calls with programmable shaders with Shader Model 1\.0 only\.<br>Draw calls with Shader Model 2\.0\+ will use the preprocessing compute pass\.|
|rtx.texturemanager.budgetPercentageOfAvailableVram|int|50|The percentage of available VRAM we should use for material textures\.  If material textures are required beyond this budget, then those textures will be loaded at lower quality\.  Important note, it's impossible to perfectly match the budget while maintaining reasonable quality levels, so use this as more of a guideline\.  If the replacements assets are simply too large for the target GPUs available vid mem, we may end up going overbudget regularly\.  Defaults to 50% of the available VRAM\.|
|rtx.texturemanager.showProgress|bool|False|Show texture loading progress in the HUD\.|
|rtx.timeDeltaBetweenFrames|float|0|Frame time delta to use during scene processing\. Setting this to 0 will use actual frame time delta for a given frame\. Non\-zero value is primarily used for automation to ensure determinism run to run\.|

|rtx.tonemap.ditherMode|int|2|Tonemap dither mode selection, dithering allows for reduction of banding artifacts in the final rendered output from quantization using a small amount of monochromatic noise\. Impact typically most visible in darker regions with smooth lighting gradients\.<br>Enabling dithering will make the rendered image slightly noisier, though usually dither noise is fairly imperceptible in most cases without looking closely\. Generally dithered results will also look better than the alternative of banding artifacts due to increasing perceptual precision of the signal\.<br>Note that temporal dithering may increase perceptual precision further but may also introduce more noticeable noise in the final output in some cases due to the noise pattern changing every frame unlike a purely spatial approach\.<br>Supported enum values are 0 = None \(Disabled\), 1 = Spatial \(Enabled, Spatial dithering only\), 2 = SpatialTemporal \(Enabled, Spatial and temporal dithering\)\.<br>Generally enabling dithering is recommended, but disabling it may be useful in some niche cases for improving compression ratios in images or videos at the cost of quality \(as noise while it may not be very visible may be more difficult to compress\), or for capturing "raw" post\-tonemapped data from the renderer\.|
|rtx.tonemap.dynamicRange|float|15|Range \[0, inf\)\. Without further adjustments, the tone curve will try to fit the entire luminance of the scene into the range \[\-dynamicRange, 0\] in linear photographic stops\.

|rtx.tonemap.toneCurveMaxStops|float|8|High endpoint of the tone curve \(in log2\(linear\)\)\.|
|rtx.tonemap.toneCurveMinStops|float|-24|Low endpoint of the tone curve \(in log2\(linear\)\)\.|
|rtx.tonemap.tonemappingEnabled|bool|True|A flag to enable or disable the local tonemapper\. Note this flag will only take effect when the global tonemapper is set to be used \(as opposed to another option such as the local tonemapper\)\.|
|rtx.tonemap.tuningMode|bool|False|A flag to enable a debug visualization to tune the tonemapping exposure curve with, as well as exposing parameters for tuning the tonemapping in the UI\.|
|rtx.tonemappingMode|int|1|The tonemapping type to use, 0 for Global, 1 for Local \(Default\)\.<br>Global tonemapping tonemaps the image with respect to global parameters, usually based on statistics about the rendered image as a whole\.<br>Local tonemapping on the other hand uses more spatially\-local parameters determined by regions of the rendered image rather than the whole image\.<br>Local tonemapping can result in better preservation of highlights and shadows in scenes with high amounts of dynamic range whereas global tonemapping may have to comprimise between over or underexposure\.|
|rtx.translucentDecalAlbedoFactor|float|10|A global scale factor applied to the albedo of decals that are applied to a translucent base material, to make the decals more visible\.<br>This is generally needed as albedo values for decals may be fairly low when dealing with opaque surfaces, but the translucent diffuse layer requires a fairly high albedo value to result in an expected look\.<br>The need for this option could be avoided by simply authoring decals applied to translucent materials with a higher albedo to begin with, but sometimes applications may share decals between different material types\.|
|rtx.translucentMaterial.enableDiffuseLayerOverride|bool|False|A flag to force the diffuse layer on the translucent material to be enabled\. Should only be used for debugging or development\.|

If it's too high, repeated objects may flicker\.<br>This does not account for sceneScale\.|
|rtx.upscalerType|int|1|Upscaling boosts performance with varying degrees of image quality tradeoff depending on the type of upscaler and the quality mode/preset\.|
|rtx.upscalingMipBias|float|0|Specifies a mipmapping level bias to add to all material texture filtering when upscaling \(such as DLSS\) is used\.<br>Mipmaps are determined based on how far away a texture is, using this can bias the desired level in a lower quality direction \(positive bias\), or a higher quality direction with potentially more aliasing \(negative bias\)\.<br>Note that mipmaps are also important for good spatial caching of textures, so too far negative of a mip bias may start to significantly affect performance, therefore changing this value is not recommended|
|rtx.useAnisotropicFiltering|bool|True|A flag to indicate if anisotropic filtering should be used on material textures, otherwise typical trilinear filtering will be used\.<br>This should generally be enabled as anisotropic filtering allows for less blurring on textures at grazing angles than typical trilinear filtering with only usually minor performance impact \(depending on the max anisotropy samples\)\.|
|rtx.useBuffersDirectly|bool|True|When enabled Remix will use the incoming vertex buffers directly where possible instead of copying data\. Note: setting the d3d9\.allowDiscard to False will disable this option\.|
|rtx.useDenoiser|bool|True|Enables usage of denoiser\(s\) when set to true, otherwise disables denoising when set to false\.<br>Denoising is important for filtering the raw noisy ray traced signal into a smoother and more stable result at the cost of some potential spatial/temporal artifacts \(ghosting, boiling, blurring, etc\)\.<br>Generally should remain enabled except when debugging behavior which requires investigating the output directly, or diagnosing denoising\-related issues\.|
|rtx.useDenoiserReferenceMode|bool|False|Enables the reference "denoiser" when set to true, otherwise uses the standard denoiser when set to false\. Note this requires the denoiser to be enabled to function\.<br>The reference denoiser allows for a reference multi\-sample per pixel contribution to accumulate which should converge slowly to the ideal result the renderer is working towards\.<br>Useful for analyzing quality differences in various denoising methods, post\-processing filters, or for more accurately comparing subtle effects of potentially biased rendering techniques which may be hard to see through usual noise and filtering\.<br>Also useful for higher quality artistic renders of a scene beyond what is possible in realtime\.|
|rtx.useHighlightLegacyMode|bool|False||
|rtx.useHighlightUnsafeAnchorMode|bool|False||
|rtx.useHighlightUnsafeReplacementMode|bool|False||
|rtx.useIntersectionBillboardsOnPrimaryRays|bool|False||
|rtx.useLiveShaderEditMode|bool|False|When set to true shaders will be automatically recompiled when any shader file is updated \(saved for instance\) in addition to the usual manual recompilation trigger\.|
|rtx.useObsoleteHashOnTextureUpload|bool|False|Whether or not to use slower XXH64 hash on texture upload\.<br>New projects should not enable this option as this solely exists for compatibility with older hashing schemes\.|
|rtx.usePartialDdsLoader|bool|True|A flag controlling if the partial DDS loader should be used, true to enable, false to disable and use GLI instead\.<br>Generally this should be always enabled as it allows for simple parsing of DDS header information without loading the entire texture into memory like GLI does to retrieve similar information\.<br>Should only be set to false for debugging purposes if the partial DDS loader's logic is suspected to be incorrect to compare against GLI's implementation\.|
|rtx.usePostFilter|bool|True|Uses post filter to remove fireflies in the denoised result\.|
|rtx.useRTXDI|bool|True|A flag indicating if RTXDI should be used, true enables RTXDI, false disables it and falls back on simpler light sampling methods\.<br>RTXDI provides improved direct light sampling quality over traditional methods and should generally be enabled for improved direct lighting quality at the cost of some performance\.|
|rtx.useRayPortalVirtualInstanceMatching|bool|True||
|rtx.useReSTIRGI|bool|True|A flag indicating if ReSTIR GI should be used, true enables ReSTIR GI, false disables it and relies on typical GI sampling\.<br>ReSTIR GI provides improved indirect path sampling over typical importance sampling and should usually be enabled for better indirect diffuse and specular GI quality at the cost of some performance\.|
|rtx.useVertexCapture|bool|True|When enabled, injects code into the original vertex shader to capture final shaded vertex positions\.  Is useful for games using simple vertex shaders, that still also set the fixed function transform matrices\.|
|rtx.useVertexCapturedNormals|bool|True|When enabled, vertex normals are read from the input assembler and used in raytracing\.  This doesn't always work as normals can be in any coordinate space, but can help sometimes\.|
|rtx.useVirtualShadingNormalsForDenoising|bool|True|A flag to enable or disable the usage of virtual shading normals for denoising passes\.<br>This is primairly important for anything that modifies the direction of a primary ray, so mainly PSR and ray portals as both of these will view a surface from an angle different from the "virtual" viewing direction perceived by the camera\.<br>This can cause some issues with denoising due to the normals not matching the expected perception of what the normals should be, for example normals facing away from the camera direction due to being viewed from a different angle via refraction or portal teleportation\.<br>To correct this, virtual normals are calculcated such that they always are oriented relative to the primary camera ray as if its direction was never altered, matching the virtual perception of the surface from the camera's point of view\.<br>As an aside, virtual normals themselves can cause issues with denoising due to the normals suddenly changing from virtual to "real" normals upon traveling through a portal, causing surface consistency failures in the denoiser, but this is accounted for via a special transform given to the denoiser on camera ray portal teleportation events\.<br>As such, this option should generally always be enabled when rendering with ray portals in the scene to have good denoising quality\.|
|rtx.useWhiteMaterialMode|bool|False|Override all objects' materials by white material|
|rtx.useWorldMatricesForShaders|bool|True|When enabled, Remix will utilize the world matrices being passed from the game via D3D9 fixed function API, even when running with shaders\.  Sometimes games pass these matrices and they are useful, however for some games they are very unreliable, and should be filtered out\.  If you're seeing precision related issues with shader vertex capture, try disabling this setting\.|
|rtx.validateCPUIndexData|bool|False||
|rtx.vertexColorStrength|float|0.6|A scalar to apply to how strong vertex color influence should be on materials\.<br>A value of 1 indicates that it should be fully considered \(though do note the texture operation and relevant parameters still control how much it should be blended with the actual albedo color\), a value of 0 indicates that it should be fully ignored\.|
|rtx.viewDistance.distanceFadeMax|float|500|The view distance based on the result of the view distance function to end view distance noise fading at \(and effectively draw nothing past this point\), only used for the Coherent Noise view distance mode\.|
|rtx.viewDistance.distanceFadeMin|float|400|The view distance based on the result of the view distance function to start view distance noise fading at, only used for the Coherent Noise view distance mode\.|
|rtx.viewDistance.distanceFunction|int|0|The view distance function, Euclidean is a simple distance from the camera, whereas Planar Euclidean will ignore distance across the world's "up" direction\.|
|rtx.viewDistance.distanceMode|int|0|The view distance mode, None disables view distance, Hard Cutoff will cut off geometry past a point, and Coherent Noise will feather geometry out using a stable worldspace noise pattern \(experimental\)\.|

|rtx.volumetricAnisotropy|float|0|The anisotropy of the scattering phase function \(\-1 being backscattering, 0 being isotropic, 1 being forward scattering\)\.|
|rtx.volumetricClampedReprojectionConfidencePenalty|float|0.5|The penalty from \[0, 1\] to apply to the sample count of temporally reprojected reservoirs when reprojection is clamped to the fustrum \(indicating lower quality reprojection\)\.|
|rtx.volumetricEnableInitialVisibility|bool|True|Determines whether to trace a visibility ray for Reservoir samples\.<br>Results in slightly higher quality froxel grid light samples at the cost of a ray per froxel cell each frame and should generally be enabled\.|
|rtx.volumetricEnableTemporalResampling|bool|True|Indicates if temporal resampling should be used for volume integration\.<br>Temporal resampling allows for reuse of temporal information when picking froxel grid light samples similar to how ReSTIR works, providing higher quality light samples\.<br>This should generally be enabled but currently due to the lack of temporal bias correction this option will slightly bias the lighting result\.|
|rtx.volumetricInitialRISSampleCount|int|8|The number of RIS samples to select from the global pool of lights when constructing a Reservoir sample\.<br>Higher values generally increases the quality of the selected light sample, though similar to the general RIS light sample count has diminishing returns\.|
|rtx.volumetricSingleScatteringAlbedo|float3|0.9, 0.9, 0.9|The single scattering albedo \(otherwise known as the particle albedo\) representing the ratio of scattering to absorption\.<br>While color\-like in many ways this value is assumed to be more of a mathematical albedo \(unlike material albedo which is treated more as a color\), and is therefore treated as linearly encoded data \(not gamma\)\.|
|rtx.volumetricTemporalReuseMaxSampleCount|int|200|The number of samples to clamp temporal reservoirs to, should usually be around the value: desired\_max\_history\_frames \* average\_reservoir\_samples\.|
|rtx.volumetricTransmittanceColor|float3|0.953237, 0.92879, 0.903545|The color to use for calculating transmittance measured at a specific distance\.<br>Note that this color is assumed to be in sRGB space and gamma encoded as it will be converted to linear for use in volumetrics\.|

|rtx.antiCulling.antiCullingTextures|hash set||Textures that are forced to extend life length when anti\-culling is enabled\.<br>Some games use different culling methods we can't fully match, use this option to manually add textures to force extend their life when anti\-culling fails\.|

|rtx.beamTextures|hash set||Textures on draw calls that are already particles or emissively blended and have beam\-like geometry\.<br>Typically objects marked as particles or objects using emissive blending will be rendered with a special method which allows re\-orientation of the billboard geometry assumed to make up the draw call in indirect rays \(reflections for example\)\.<br>This method works fine for typical particles, but some \(e\.g\. a laser beam\) may not be well\-represented with the typical billboard assumption of simply needing to rotate around its centroid to face the view direction\.<br>To handle such cases a different beam mode is used to treat objects as more of a cylindrical beam and re\-orient around its main spanning axis, allowing for better rendering of these beam\-like effect objects\.|

|rtx.hideInstanceTextures|hash set||Textures on draw calls that should be hidden from rendering, but not totally ignored\.<br>This is similar to rtx\.ignoreTextures but instead of completely ignoring such draw calls they are only hidden from rendering, allowing for the hidden objects to still appear in captures\.<br>As such, this is mostly only a development tool to hide objects during development until they are properly replaced, otherwise the objects should be ignored with rtx\.ignoreTextures instead for better performance\.|
|rtx.ignoreBakedLightingTextures|hash set||Textures for which to ignore two types of baked lighting, Texture Factors and Vertex Color\.<br><br>Texture Factor disablement:<br>Using this feature on selected textures will eliminate the texture factors\.<br>For instance, if a game bakes lighting information into the Texture Factor for particular textures, applying this option will remove them\.<br>This becomes useful when unexpected results occur due to the Texture Factor\.<br>Consider an example where the original texture contains red tints baked into the Texture Factor\. If a user replaces the texture, it will blend with the red tints, resulting in an undesirable reddish outcome\.<br>In such cases, users can employ this option to eliminate the unwanted tints from their replacement textures\.<br>Similarly, users can tag textures if shadows are baked into the Texture Factor, causing the replacing texture to appear darker than anticipated\.<br><br>Vertex Color disablement:<br>Using this feature on selected textures will eliminate the vertex colors\.<br><br>Note, enabling this setting will automatically disable multiple\-stage texture factor blendings for the selected textures\.<br>Only use this option when necessary, as the Texture Factor and Vertex Color can be used for simulating various texture effects, tagging a texture with this option will unexpectedly eliminate these effects\.|
|rtx.ignoreLights|hash set||Lights that should be ignored\.<br>Any matching light will be skipped and not added to be ray traced\.|
|rtx.ignoreTextures|hash set||Textures on draw calls that should be ignored\.<br>Any draw call using an ignore texture will be skipped and not ray traced, useful for removing undesirable rasterized effects or geometry not suitable for ray tracing\.|

|rtx.nonOffsetDecalTextures|hash set||Warning: This option is deprecated, please use rtx\.decalTextures instead\.<br>Textures on draw calls used for geometric decals with arbitrary topology that are already offset from the base geometry\.<br>These materials will be blended over the materials underneath them when decal material blending is enabled\.<br>Unlike typical decals however these decals have no offset applied to them due assuming the offset is already being done by whatever is passing data to Remix\.|

Textures must be tagged as "Decal Texture" or "Dynamic Decal Texture" to apply\.<br>Applies a single shared offset to all the batched decal geometry rendered in a given draw call, rather than increasing offset per decal within the batch \(i\.e\. a quad in case of "Dynamic Decal Texture"\)\.<br>Note, the offset adds to the global offset among all decals drawn with different draw calls\.<br>The decal textures tagged this way must not inter\-overlap within a batch / single draw call since the same offset is applied to all of them\.<br>Applying a single offset is useful for stabilizing decal offsets when a game dynamically batches decals together\.<br>In addition, it makes the global decal offset index grow slower and thus it minimizes a chance of hitting the "rtx\.decals\.maxOffsetIndex limit"\.|
|rtx.skyBoxGeometries|hash set||Geometries from draw calls used for the sky or are otherwise intended to be very far away from the camera at all times \(no parallax\)\.<br>Any draw calls using a geometry hash in this list will be treated as sky and rendered as such in a manner different from typical geometry\.<br>The geometry hash being used for sky detection is based off of the asset hash rule, see: "rtx\.geometryAssetHashRuleString"\.|
|rtx.skyBoxTextures|hash set||Textures on draw calls used for the sky or are otherwise intended to be very far away from the camera at all times \(no parallax\)\.<br>Any draw calls using a texture in this list will be treated as sky and rendered as such in a manner different from typical geometry\.|
|rtx.sourceRootPath|string||A path pointing at the root folder of the project, used to override the path to the root of the project generated at build\-time \(as this path is only valid for the machine the project was originally compiled on\)\. Used primarily for locating shader source files for runtime shader recompilation\.|
|rtx.terrainTextures|hash set||Albedo textures that are baked blended together to form a unified terrain texture used during ray tracing\.<br>Put albedo textures into this category if the game renders terrain as a blend of multiple textures\.|
|rtx.uiTextures|hash set||Textures on draw calls that should be treated as screenspace UI elements\.<br>All exclusively UI\-related textures should be classified this way and doing so allows the UI to be rasterized on top of the ray traced scene like usual\.<br>Note that currently the first UI texture encountered triggers RTX injection \(though this may change in the future as this does cause issues with games that draw UI mid\-frame\)\.|
|rtx.welcomeMessage|string||Display a message to the user on startup, leave empty if no message is to be displayed\.|
|rtx.worldSpaceUiBackgroundTextures|hash set||Hack/workaround option for dynamic world space UI textures with a coplanar background\.<br>Apply to backgrounds if the foreground material is a dynamic world texture rendered in UI that is unpredictable and rapidly changing\.<br>This offsets the background texture backwards\.|
|rtx.worldSpaceUiTextures|hash set||Textures on draw calls that should be treated as worldspace UI elements\.<br>Unlike typical UI textures this option is useful for improved rendering of UI elements which appear as part of the scene \(moving around in 3D space rather than as a screenspace element\)\.|
